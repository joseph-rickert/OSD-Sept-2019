title: "Polar Ice - R Notebook"
output: html_notebook

This notebook uses the R [rnoaa package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rnoaa) on CRAN to visualize polar the change in the polar ice pack over time. 

Load the R packages required to fetch the data and generate maps.
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(rnoaa)
library(plyr)
library("ggplot2")

```

Select the time frame to examine and fetch the data.

```{r}
urls <- seaiceeurls(mo = 'Apr', pole = 'N', yr = 2018)
out <- seaice(urls)  
``` 


Generate the maps.

```{r}
ggplot(out, aes(long, lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill = "steelblue") +
  theme_ice()

urls <- seaiceeurls(mo = 'Apr', pole = 'N')[1:10]
out <- lapply(urls, seaice)
names(out) <- seq(2009, 2018, 1)
df <- ldply(out)

ggplot(df, aes(long, lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill = "steelblue") +
  theme_ice() +
  facet_wrap(~.id)
```   

It is possible to produce such a sophisticated result with just a few lines of code, because of the extensive infrastructure underlying the R language, the collaborative development of the code, the continual testing and the integration of several software systems: not only R packages but also the APIs used to make the NOAA data available.

The [`rnoaa` package documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rnoaa) illustrates the complexity, collaboration and testing.
